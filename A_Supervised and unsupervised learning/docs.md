# Note
+ Machine learning problems, there are generally two types of data(models):
  + Supervised data: always has one or multiple targets associated with it.
  + Unsupervised data: does not have any target variable.
+ Supervised problems can be divided into two sub-classes:
  + Classification: predicting a category, e.g. dog or cat...
  + Regression: predicting a value, e.g. house prices...

+ Unsupervised problems: to tackle these kinds of problems we have to think about how many clusters can data divided into.
**Clustering** is one of the approaches that you can use for problems like this. Using some techniques such as:
  + Principal component analysis(PCA)
  + t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE)
  + ...

# Code 
+ Show MNIST dataset, convert supervised classification problem to unsupervised problem.
+ Using t-SNE decomposition of the MNIST dataset.
